# Java Basics: Statements, Expressions, Logical Operators, and Conditional Statements

This repository contains a single Java file `Main.java` which illustrates several core concepts of Java:

1. Statements
2. Expressions
3. Logical Operators
4. Conditional Statements
5. Chaining and Nesting
6. Flag Variables

Each concept is clearly marked within the code with comments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <url of this repo>
```

Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
Open the `Main.java` file.

#### Opening the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Click on `File > Open`.
3. Navigate to the location of the cloned repository.
4. Select the project folder and click `OK`.
5. In the Project Explorer on the left, open the `Main.java` file.


## Exploring the Code

Within `Main.java`, you'll find examples for each of the topics we've covered. Here's what you can do to further understand these concepts:

**Statements**: Look at the different types of statements in the code. Try adding your own statements, both declarations and control flow statements.

**Expressions**: Try modifying the expressions given in the code, and check if the output matches your expectations.

**Logical Operators**: Experiment with the given boolean variables and operators. Try adding more conditions and see how the output changes.

**Conditional Statements**: Examine the if-else and switch statements. Try modifying the conditions and see what happens. Add some more cases in the switch statement.

**Chaining and Nesting**: Look at the if-else-if chain and the nested if statement. Try changing the values and conditions to see what the output will be. Try adding more levels of nesting.

**Flag Variables**: Understand how the flag variable is used to control access based on a condition. Try using a flag variable in a different scenario.

# Java Conditional Statement and Expression Examples

This project contains several classes, each demonstrating different Java concepts including statements, expressions, logical operators, and conditional statements. The main method in each class contains code examples and TODO tasks for you to complete.

## Overview of Classes

1. **StatementsExample**: This class introduces Java statements. You'll work with an expression statement, a declaration statement, and a control flow statement.

2. **ExpressionsExample**: This class explores different types of expressions in Java, including arithmetic expressions, String expressions, and Boolean expressions.

3. **LogicalOperatorsExample**: This class demonstrates the use of logical operators in Java. You'll work with Boolean values and a control flow statement that uses the logical AND and NOT operators.

4. **ConditionalStatementsExample**: This class introduces conditional statements in Java, specifically if-else and switch statements. You'll use these statements to control the flow of execution based on different conditions.

5. **AdvancedConditionalStatementsExample**: This class explores advanced conditional statements, including chaining and nesting of if-else statements.

6. **FlagVariablesExample**: This class introduces flag variables in Java. You'll work with a Boolean flag variable that changes its value based on a condition.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open each class in your preferred Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans).
3. Review the code and complete the TODO tasks in each class. The tasks are designed to get you to experiment with the code and observe the changes in output.
4. Run each class separately to see the output in your IDE's console.

Happy coding!
